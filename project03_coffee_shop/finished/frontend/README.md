#### Installing Ionic Cli

The Ionic Command Line Interface is required to serve and build the frontend. Instructions for installing the CLI  is in the [Ionic Framework Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

#### Installing project dependencies

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

```bash
ionic serve
```
