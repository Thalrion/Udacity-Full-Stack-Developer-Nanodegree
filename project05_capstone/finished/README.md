## Start Project locally

Make sure you `cd` into the correct folder (with all app files) before following the setup steps.
Also, you need the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your machine.

To start and run the local development server,

1. Initialize and activate a virtualenv:
  ```bash
  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  ```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Change database config so it can connect to your local postgres database
- Open `config.py` with your editor of choice. 
- Here you can see this dict:
 ```python
database_setup = {
    "database_name_production" : "agency",
    "database_name_test" : "agency_test",
    "user_name" : "postgres", # default postgres user name
    "password" : "testpassword123", # if applicable. If no password, just type in None
    "port" : "localhost:5432" # default postgres port
}
```

 - Just change `user_name`, `password` and `port` to whatever you choose while installing postgres.
>_tip_: `user_name` usually defaults to `postgres` and `port` always defaults to `localhost:5432` while installing postgres, most of the time you just need to change the `password`.

4. Setup Auth0
If you already know your way around `Auth0`, just insert your data 
into `config.py` => auth0_config

If you are new, follow [these](#authentification) steps:

5. Run the development server:
  ```bash 
  $ python app.py
  ```

## API Documentation

Here you can find all existing endpoints, which methods can be used, how to work with them & example responses you´ll get.

Additionally, common pitfalls & error messages are explained, if applicable.

### Base URL

Since this API is not hosted on a specific domain, it can only be accessed when
`flask` is run locally. To make requests to the API via `curl` or `postman`,
you need to use the default domain on which the flask server is running.

**_http://127.0.0.1:8080/_**

### Available Endpoints

Here is a short table about which ressources exist and which method you can use on them.

                          Allowed Methods
       Endpoints    |  GET |  POST |  DELETE | PATCH  |
                    |------|-------|---------|--------|
      /actors       |  [x] |  [x]  |   [x]   |   [x]  |   
      /movies       |  [x] |  [x]  |   [x]   |   [x]  |

# <a name="authentification"></a>
## Authentification

All API Endpoints are decorated with Auth0 permissions. To use the project locally, you need to config Auth0 accordingly

### Auth0 for locally use
#### Create an App & API

1. Login to https://manage.auth0.com/ 
2. Click on Applications Tab
3. + Create Application
4. Give it a name like `Music` and select "Regular Web Application"
5. Go to Settings and find `domain`. Copy & paste it into config.py => auth0_config['AUTH0_DOMAIN'] (i.e. replace `"example-matthew.eu.auth0.com"`)
6. Click on API Tab 
7. Create a new API:
   1. Name: `Music`
   2. Identifier `Music`
   3. Keep Algorithm as it is
8. Go to Settings and find `Identifier`. Copy & paste it into config.py => auth0_config['API_AUDIENCE'] (i.e. replace `"Example"`)

#### Create Roles & Permissions

1. Before creating `Roles & Permissions`, you need to `Enable RBAC` in your API (API => Click on your API Name => Settings = Enable RBAC => Save)
2. Also, check the button `Add Permissions in the Access Token`.
2. First, create a new Role under `Users and Roles` => `Roles` => `Create Roles`
3. Give it a descriptive name like `Casting Assistant`.
4. Go back to the API Tab and find your newly created API. Click on Permissions.
5. Create & assign all neede permissions accordingly 
6. After you created all permissions this app needs, go back to `Users and Roles` => `Roles` and select the role you recently created.
6. Under `Permissions`, assign all permissions you want this role to have.
