### Project 1: Booking Site Fy-yur

Aim of the project was to build a full-stack App with Flask and Boostrap.

Used tech stack:
- SQLAlchemy ORM as ORM library of choice
- PostgreSQL as database

- Flask-Migrate for creating and running schema migrations
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Javascript with Bootstrap 3

Applied contepts:
- Configure local database and connect it to a web application
- Create Model Schemas with columns and relationships (1:1, 1:n and N:N)
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL to Query, Insert, Edit & Delete Data
- Use WTForms to encapsulate Input Forms in seperate File & to allow for custom validations
- Use Boostrap as a simple to use Front End Libary
- Create SQL-like Queries, but without any SQL Syntax, only using SQLAlchemy ORM.
- How to clearly structurize a larger web application in different files & folders.
