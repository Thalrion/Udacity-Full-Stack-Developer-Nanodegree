- Python3 and Flask for server language and API development
- `test-driven-development (TDD)` to rapidly create highly tested & maintainable endpoints.
- `cors` to handle access to the API
- `unittest` for automated testing of APIs
- `curl` to get responses from API
- `README.md` to document project setup & how to work with the API
